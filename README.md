# Patient Satisfaction Project

This is a patient satisfaction survey that most hospitals are required to submit to The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).

The survey asks patients questions like:
Was the hospital always quiet and clean at night?
Did the nurses and doctors treat you with respect?
Did you receive call button help as soon as possible?
Did you understand your discharge instructions?
Patients are asked to rate how often these things happend. "Usually", "Sometimes or Never", or "Always". 
The "Always" wording is what hospitals aim for, and is called a Top Box answer.
